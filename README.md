##What is this?

It's a site devoted to teaching hapi.js through screencasts. It's an opportunity for me to get into greater depth on material I couldn't in [the book](http://manning.com/harrison), in a hands-on way. Books aren't for everyone, sometimes a different media like video reaches people in a different way.

##When will this site be ready?

I'm mainly focussed at the moment on getting [my book](http://manning.com/harrison) finished so this is something of a backburner. Once that's finished I will be able to devote a lot of the time sacrificed to write it over to this project. That said I hope to get the site live with at least one video before the end of 2015.

##Can we request videos?

YES! There's going to be a feature on the site to request and vote on videos (similar to Pluralsight's system). You'll need to log in with Github to vote.

##Are you taking PRs?

Not at the moment. If you wish to make a suggestion however, I'm all ears. Please make an issue.

##What's the site built with?

- hapi (of course)
- React
- Redux
- Browserify
